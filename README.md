# Analyzing Crime in Los Angeles

Los Angeles, California ðŸ˜Ž. The City of Angels. Tinseltown. The Entertainment Capital of the World!

Known for its warm weather, palm trees, sprawling coastline, and Hollywood, along with producing some of the most iconic films and songs. However, as with any highly populated city, it isn't always glamorous and there can be a large volume of crime. That's where you can help!

I have been asked to support the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) by analyzing crime data to identify patterns in criminal behavior. They plan to use my insights to allocate resources effectively to tackle various crimes in different areas.

## Overview

This project involves analyzing crime data from Los Angeles to identify patterns and trends. The main goals are:
- Identify which hour has the highest frequency of crimes.
- Determine the area with the largest frequency of night crimes (crimes committed between 10pm and 3:59am).
- Analyze the number of crimes committed against victims by different age groups.

## Libraries Used

- matplotlib
- seaborn
- pandas
- numpy

## Data

The dataset used in this analysis is a CSV file containing crime reports from Los Angeles. The columns in the dataset include:

- `DR_NO`: Report number
- `Date Rptd`: Date reported
- `DATE OCC`: Date occurred
- `TIME OCC`: Time occurred
- `AREA NAME`: Name of the area
- `Crm Cd Desc`: Description of the crime code
- `Vict Age`: Age of the victim
- `Vict Sex`: Sex of the victim
- `Vict Descent`: Descent of the victim
- `Weapon Desc`: Description of the weapon used
- `Status Desc`: Status of the case
- `LOCATION`: Location of the crime

## Analysis Steps

1. **Read and inspect the dataset**: Load the dataset and inspect its structure and contents.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values, convert data types, and create additional columns if necessary.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualize data to find patterns and trends.
4. **Results Interpretation**: Summarize the findings and insights gained from the analysis.

## Insights

- **Highest Frequency of Crimes**: Identified the hour with the highest frequency of crimes.
- **Night Crimes**: Determined the area with the largest volume of night crimes.
- **Victim Age Groups**: Analyzed the number of crimes committed against different age groups.

## Conclusion

The analysis provides valuable insights into crime patterns in Los Angeles, helping the LAPD allocate resources effectively to tackle crimes in different areas and times.
